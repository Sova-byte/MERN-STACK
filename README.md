# MERN Stack Journey 🚀

## Overview 👀
This repository documents my daily progress and learning as I build projects and explore the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Starting from Day 1, I will push updates regularly to track my journey, including code, notes, and key takeaways. This project serves as both a learning log and a portfolio of my MERN stack development skills.
