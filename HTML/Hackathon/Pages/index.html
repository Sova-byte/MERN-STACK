            <h1>HOW DO YOU ACCESS THE WEB üåê?</h1>

            <h4> Before we look at the code used to build websites it is important to consider the <br>
                different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology.</h4>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h3>üî¥ BROWSERS</h3>

                        <p>üí† People access websites using
                            software called a <strong>web browser</strong>.
                            Popular examples include
                            Chrome, Brave, Safari,
                            Microsoft Edge, and Opera.</p>

                        <p>üí† In order to view a web page,
                            users might type a web address
                            into their browser, follow a
                            link from another site, or use a
                            bookmark.</p>

                        <p>üí† Software manufacturers
                            regularly release new versions
                            of browsers with new features
                            and supporting new additions
                            to languages. It is important,
                            however, to remember that
                            many computer owners will not
                            be running the latest versions
                            of these browsers.</p>
                        <p>üí† Therefore
                            you cannot rely on all visitors to
                            your site being able to use the
                            latest functionality offered in all
                            browsers.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td></td>

                        <p>üí† When you ask your browser for
                            a web page, the request is sent
                            across the Internet to a special
                            computer known as a <strong>web
                                server</strong> which hosts the website.</p>
                        <p>üí† Web servers are special
                            computers that are constantly
                            connected to the Internet, and
                            are optimized to send web pages
                            out to people who request them.</p>
                        <p>üí† Some big companies run their
                            own web servers, but it is more
                            common to use the services of
                            a <strong>web hosting</strong> company who
                            charge a fee to host your site.</p>
                        <p>üí†People are accessing websites
                            on an increasing range of devices
                            including desktop computers,
                            laptops, tablets, and mobile
                            phones. It is important to
                            remember that various devices
                            have different screen sizes and
                            some have faster connections to
                            the web than others</p>

            <h4>All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
                management systems, blogging software, <br>and
                e-commerce platforms often add a few more

                        <p>üí† When you are looking at a
                            website, it is most likely that
                            your browser will be receiving
                            HTML and CSS from the web
                            server that hosts the site. The
                            web browser interprets the
                            HTML and CSS code to create
                            the page that you see.
                        </p>

                        <p>üí† Most web pages also include
                            extra content such as images,
                            audio, video, or animations. </p>

                        <p>üí† Some sites also send JavaScript
                            to your browser, and you
                            will see how to add JavaScript
                            and Flash in your web pages.
                            Both of these technologies are
                            advanced topics that you can go
                            on to learn more about once you
                            have mastered HTML and CSS, if
                            you want to.</p>

                        <p>üí† Small websites are often written
                            just using HTML and CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>üí† Larger websites ‚Äî in particular
                            those that are updated regularly
                            and use a content management
                            system (CMS), blogging tools, or
                            e-commerce software ‚Äî often
                            make use of more complex
                            technologies on the web server,
                            but these technologies are
                            actually used to produce HTML
                            and CSS that is then sent to the
                            browser. So, if your site uses
                            these technologies, you will be
                            able to use your new HTML and
                            CSS knowledge to take more
                            control over how your site looks.</p>
                        <p>üí† Larger, more complex sites like
                            these may use a database to
                            store data, and programming
                            languages such as MySQL, MongoDB,
                            Java, or ExpressJS on the web server,
                            but you do not need to know
                            these technologies to improve
                            what the user sees. The HTML skills
                            you'll learn in this website should be
                            enough to help you on that road.</p>

                        <p>üí† Since the web was first created
                            there have been several versions
                            of HTML and CSS ‚Äî each
                            intended to be an improvement
                            on the previous version. </p>
                        <p>üí† At the time of creating this
                            website, HTML5 & CSS3 were
                            still being developed. Although
                            they had not been finalized,
                            many browsers were already
                            supporting some features of
                            these languages and a lot of
                            people were using the latest
                            code on their websites. We have
                            therefore chosen to teach you
                            these latest versions. </p>
                        <p>üí† Because HTML5 and CSS3
                            build on previous versions of
                            these languages, learning these
                            means you will also be able to
                            understand the earlier versions
                            of them.</p>
